TANSTAAFL!

There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch when you're flying in space.

Tanstaafl will ultimately be a free space flight simulator, written in Common Lisp.

At the moment, I'm making no attempts at cross-platform compatibility at all.
My first priority is to make it work. I'm using CLISP, and I have no intention of
switching or trying to support another CL implementation at the moment, though
nobody knows what the future will bring. Obviously, anybody else is welcome to help
with that (and anything else).

A more informative README is in the works.
