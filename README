TANSTAAFL!

There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch when you're flying in space.

Tanstaafl will ultimately be a free space flight simulator, written in Common Lisp.
Tanstaafl is modeled on Orbiter. It exists mainly because Orbiter is closed source,
and is Windows only (neither of which make me happy).

At the moment, I'm making no attempts at cross-platform compatibility at all.
My first priority is to make it work. I'm using CLISP, and I have no intention of
switching or trying to support another CL implementation at the moment, though
nobody knows what the future will bring. Obviously, anybody else is welcome to help
with that (and anything else).

I'm developing tanstaafl on a system running Fedora 11.
This is as complete a list of dependencies as I can think of
(with dependencies of the listed packages included implicitly):
X11
clisp
gcc
freeglut
glx-utils
mesa-libGLU # or some other implementation
mesa-libGL  # of OpenGL

A more informative README is in the works.
